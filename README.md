# Weaviate-Practice

Practice using Weaviates Python client to manage a WCS instance of Weaviate for a 'Tiny Jeopardy!' data set.

Goals:
1. Build a Weaviate vector database
2. Query it with:
    - Semantic search
    - Added filters
    - generative searches to transform search results with a large language model (LLM).

Using:<br/>
- Sample datastore provided by Weaviate (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaviate-tutorials/quickstart/main/data/jeopardy_tiny.json)
- text2vec-openai API to vectorize raw data
